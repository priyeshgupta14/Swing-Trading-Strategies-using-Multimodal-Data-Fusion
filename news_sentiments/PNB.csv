Bankers expect the new entity to be up and running by the first quarter of the new fiscal.Lenders have identified about Rs 2 lakh crore of bad loans for which they expect Rs 40,000-50,000 crore. These assets will be transferred to the new ARC at 15% upfront cash, about the level of capital being infused into the company.    81264989""The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wanted this ARC to fit into the existing structure for these companies and after consultations, care has been taken that there is no special treatment for this entity,” said a second person involved in the discussions. “For example, RBI was sceptical of the 15:85 structure. To address that, the government is guaranteeing the security receipts (SRs). RBI also wanted a market determined price discovery; so we have adopted the Swiss challenge method to ensure robust price discovery.""SRs are issued by ARCs to banks during the purchase of bad loans. They are redeemed at the time of recovery of the loans. Under the Swiss challenge method, new bidders are allowed to better an initial bid following which the first bidder is given a chance to either match or improve on the highest bid. Banks have also blocked the domain name National ARC, logging a request for government approval.",neutral,error,-1.3285024154589304,negative,-0.1215066828675508,neutral

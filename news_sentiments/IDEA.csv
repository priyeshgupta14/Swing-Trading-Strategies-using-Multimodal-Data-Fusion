The 59 apps were quickly removed from Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store following the ban order by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).However, their websites remain accessible to users through India's telecom networks, and a few small internet service providers (ISPs). Orders on Club Factory were successfully placed as late as July 8, nine days after the ban was announced. Sources told ET that Club Factory orders were also being shipped by multiple e-commerce logistics companies.Some users reported that they have been able to place orders on Shein’s website, while Romwe’s website was still accessible, although users were unable to place orders as the payment systems were disabled. “Payment is temporarily unavailable, please come back later,” read a banner on the Romwe website.ET accessed screenshots of orders placed through Club Factory and Shein earlier this week, with delivery tracking indicating that orders would be shipped in the coming days.There are also indications that these ecommerce firms could be circumventing the ban by offering customers alternative links to download their apps. They may also be using multiple domains.A senior executive at a large telecom operator told ET that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had sought blocking of particular domain names but telecom companies have found that these Chinese e-commerce players were using several domain names to bypass the firewall.“Telcos are trying to find the various DNS (Domain Name Server) of the combination and have informed the government that there are other DNSes that are making the sites active,” the executive added. Telecom operators Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Jio did not respond to ET’s queries. DoT also did not respond. Club Factory and Shein did not respond to emails till press time Thursday, while no Romwe spokesperson could be reached for comment.Club Factory, which is the largest among the three banned ecommerce platforms, provides a link on its official Instagram handle from where users can download the Android Package to install its app on Android devices. While the app was fully functional, ET found that the one-time-password required to place orders was not getting delivered.",neutral,error,6.521739130434799,positive,-1.999999999999993,negative

They added that auction could also lead to Jio and Airtel gaining more market share at the cost of Vodafone Idea.Goldman Sachs expects “Jio to have largely closed its gap with Bharti and Vi on total spectrum,” though it said data carried on the Mukesh Ambani-led telco’s 4G network is almost 2 times that on Airtel’s, and accordingly, the latter’s spectrum holding still remains “materially higher vs Jio”.They, in fact, expect both Jio and Airtel to further grow market share with their bolstered countrywide spectrum footprints, and see cash-strapped Vi, which was a marginal player in the latest spectrum sale, likely getting weaker.Vi, which spent a modest Rs 1,993.40 crore in acquiring spectrum in 5 circles, is reckoned to have not renewed a sizable chunk of its expiring 1800 Mhz spectrum, which could hurt its future competitiveness unless it raises funds quickly to ramp up its 4G operations.Analysts said Jio and Airtel’s latest auction spends -- of Rs 57,123 crore and Rs 18,699 crore respectively – would have only marginal impact on their balance sheets, by likely raising their respective leverage levels (read: net debt to Ebitda) to roughly around 2.4x and 3.6x from 0.7x and 3x now.Analysts said Airtel’s bidding strategy to plug gaps in its sub-Ghz spectrum holdings by opting to buy 800 Mhz airwaves in key markets – Madhya Pradesh, UP-West and Haryana -- where it did not have 900 Mhz spectrum, “was a smart move that would tone up its 4G coverage and also enable limited-scale 5G rollouts in key markets”.They, though, said Airtel’s decision not renew 1800 Mhz spectrum in Mumbai, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana – is “purely need-based” as it has adequate back-up airwaves in other bands in these circles.Ankit Jain, assistant vice president, ICRA, said Jio and Airtel’s consolidation of sub-Ghz spectrum bands “will be crucial for 5G technology deployments and for improvement in indoor coverage” He added that the appetite for the 2300 Mhz band, in turn stemmed from the rising mobile broadband usage and thus the need for improving network capacity.Rajiv Sharma said that Jio’s aggressive bidding signals its efforts to bulk up on sub-Ghz, mid-band and capacity spectrum to accommodate a potential surge in its 4G customer base after it launches the much-awaited budget smartphone with Google”.Jio Platforms recently raised more than Rs 1.52 lakh-crore by selling stakes to the likes of Google, Facebook, Qualcomm and Intel amongst others.Jio was the only telco facing a must-buy situation as its airwaves in the 800 Mhz band that it owns and also uses as part of a sharing pact with Reliance Communications are expiring in 18 circles in July.",neutral,error,-2.6200873362445325,negative,0.0,neutral

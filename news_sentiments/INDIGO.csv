Budget airline IndiGo, too, is hiring across all functions.India’s aviation industry, like its peers, was deeply impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which battered industries across the world. Most airlines announced deep salary cuts and also laid off staff.Growth in demand, which has picked up pace in the last few months will, however, be slugging in the coming months, especially due to a spurt in Covid-19 cases and fresh rules of testing flyers for coronavirus as mandated by state governments. That will rein in expansion and hiring, said airline executives.“While we have been taking measured steps towards growing our operations, we have also been hiring very selectively to address specific business requirements,” said a spokesperson at Vistara, without specifying numbers. “These have been mainly for select operational roles, replacements of voluntary exits, and strategic needs, etc. We plan to continue to invest in people resources in line with our expansion plans.”The spokesperson said that while the domestic market has been gradually moving towards the pre-Covid levels, the airline got the opportunity to launch operations to six new international destinations under India’s travel bubble agreements with different countries. “In a span of a few months, we launched Dhaka, Doha, London, Frankfurt, Sharjah and Male. We also inducted two new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, two Airbus A321neos and four Airbus A320neo aircraft to our fleet in the calendar year 2020,” the spokesperson said.IndiGo is trying to get closer to its pre-Covid staff count. “We started our gradual rehiring process in December 2020 and are now hiring across most functions at IndiGo and Agile (the airline’s airport services subsidiary),” said IndiGo’s head of HR, Raj Raghavan. “We are excited to get some of our old colleagues back in our fold, wherever feasible, in this process of rehiring.""The airline has been adding planes although to replace older aircraft. It announced flights to seven new destinations in January and 22 new regional flights in February.The aviation industry lost over 39,000 jobs in the April-September period last year, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri told the parliament, earlier this month. Vistara’s spokesperson said, “Even during one of the most difficult times in the history of Indian aviation, our focus was on saving all jobs. There were no reductions in the over 4,000 staff strength at Vistara during the pandemic.” GoAir, another budget carrier, is hiring too.A spokesperson for the airline said, “GoAir is continuously in the process of ramping up operations and has been adding capacity month-on-month. In this process we have identified requirements to cater to the increased operations. We have invited applications for type rated pilots for our fleet.“We currently have over 4,100 employees who are actively engaged for operations. That number is expected to rise with increase in operations. During the lockdown, we had around 1,100 employees who were actively engaged. So, we have come a long way since then and we look forward to further improvements once the summer schedule is operative from March 27, 2021.” With the increase in the domestic airlines capacity to 80% of pre-Covid levels in December 2020, from 33% in May 2020, the recovery in the domestic aircraft traffic has been gradual, reaching 73% of previous year level in January this year, ICRA said in a note on Monday.“We expect passenger traffic to grow by around 133% in FY2022 and 14% in FY2023 after a contraction of 63% in FY2021. Given that the domestic recovery is hampered by sluggish demand from leisure and business travel, and the recovery in international travel is contingent on various government measures for control of Covid amid surgence of variants as well as success of mass vaccination, the domestic traffic is likely to reach pre-Covid levels in FY2023 and international in FY2024,” said Anupama Arora, vice president, ICRA, in the note.The recent rules allowing only travellers with Covid-19 negative test results to fly has already led to a 15% dip in bookings, said airline executives.",neutral,error,4.636150234741784,positive,2.5128498001142203,positive
